A browser-based card matching game (also known as _Concentration_)

The game board should consist of 16 "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of 8 different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched
